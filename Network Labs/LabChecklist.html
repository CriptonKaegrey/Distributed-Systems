    Lab-1:
    I haven't worked with WireShark before so I was little confused during installation but the lab instructions are very 
    clear. After installation I followed the steps and I was able to filter out the http protocol requests. After clicking on
    the get request of http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/INTRO-wireshark-file1.html I was able to get some information 
    and also its packet content.</pre>
    
    <pre>
    Lab-2:
    Firstly I'm running a windows machine so I downloaded pingplotter. I was very confused at first because in the free version 
    there is no option for changing the size of datagram packet. I changed to premium version which is free for 1 week but still
    there is no option for number of times to trace. After understanding how pingplotter works I entered target ip as 
    http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/INTRO-wireshark-file1.html and sent datagrams for different sizes. Wireshark was running
    in the background and I captured the packets. Then I searched for ICMP protocol which had ECHO REQUEST. Then I noticed fragmentation
    in datagram size of 2000. Also there is also ICMP TTL-exceeded in the info column shwoing the number of hops a datagram packet can 
    take. I couldn't change the number of times to trace but this way I was able to capture more data.

    Lab-3:
    I worked with nslookup and ipconfig first, followed the steps, everything worket fine. I have worked with both before but the 
    arguments added were new to me so I tried all of them out. Then I followed the steps for tracing DNS with Wireshark, located
    the DNS query and response and looked at answers returned. The only pecular thing I noticed is for some DNS servers during DNS 
    lookup in the command line when provided the DNS server and host both, it didn't work.

    Lab-4:
    First, I started with basic HTTP get/response interaction. It was a simple HTML file request/response. Then I learned about
    conditional get/response. In browser with the help of cache certain html pages are stored. According to me it can be noticed
    from WireShark that it stores response in some frame and when host requests the same get request, it is refering to the same frame.
    Retrieving long documents was pretty much the same but due to size limit the reponse is divided into more than one reponse. Then 
    I wroked with HTML having embedded objects(image in this case). The images are supposed to be retrieved from different webpages. 
    I noticed that cover image was coming from different ip address but the pearson image was retrieved from the server ip address 
    and that was little weird. Then I came across HTTP Authentication. It includes Authentication from the user and thus require 
    two get/response requests.

    Lab-5:
    This lab is centered around only one example that is tracing bulk TCP transfer. At first I was confused by looking at all those TCP
    requests. Later I understood it is just a whole sequence starting with the transfer having SYN message. I also toggled with HTML 
    protocols to get a better understanding. The graph very interesting to me which showed the whole sequence. I was confused at first 
    because my graph was very different then the one shown in lab document. Later I realized its because of internet speed and processing
    power. I was able to complete the same task in 0.3 seconds instead of 5.5 seconds and was able to send long segments together. I also
    went through one video to understand how the graph works.
    </pre>

    Lab-6:
    I looked over the UDP packets getting transfered without applying any filters. I followed all the questions and looked over packets.
    Their size, their content and length. It was pretty basic I didn't do much here but overall experience of completing the whole lab was fun.
